# New Student Orientation Practise
Author: Zhiyuan Zhang
## Introduction
When we first start school, we usually do a lot of programming training. 
Therefore, we will mainly focus on learning Python programming later on, 
while also incorporating some chemistry-related background.

We will use Python to process and organize chemical information.

We have developed a Python library called `Hotpot` (https://github.com/Zhang-Zhiyuan-zzy/hotpot) 
specifically for the above tasks and for performing high-throughput calculations using molecular 
simulation/quantum chemistry/machine learning software. Later on, we will learn how to use `Hotpot`
step by step (installation -> usage -> development).

## Practise 1
### Resume
#### Task objectives:
1) Configuring the Python environment for running Hotpot.
2) Installing Hotpot using pip.
3) Using Hotpot to construct a 3D benzene molecule.

#### Workflow:
1) Install WSL2 on your PC (requires Windows 10, recommended Windows 11).
2) Install Miniconda3 (Linux version) on WSL2. Download URL: https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/.
3) Follow the installation instructions on the Hotpot GitHub page to configure the Conda environment and install Hotpot using pip.
4) Open Python in the WSL hp conda environment (type the following commands in the command line: 
> conda activate hp

open python console by type `python` in WSL command line  and in the Python interface type:
> import hotpot as hp

to verify that the installation was successful.

5) Follow the usage instructions on the Hotpot GitHub page to initialize a benzene molecule and construct the 3D structure.

#### Task completion criteria:
1) Code to build the benzene molecule and its 3D structure using Hotpot.
2) The coordinates of each atom in the benzene molecule.

`Note: Carefully read the Hotpot tutorial and make use of search engines 
(such as Bing or Google) and ChatGPT for assistance. All difficulties can 
be resolved online.`
